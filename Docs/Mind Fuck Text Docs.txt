[Basics]

{changing to a different index}
> - goes to the next index.
< - goes to the previous index.

{changing the value of the index}
+ - increments the value of the index.
- - decrements the value of the index.
* - multiplies the value of the index by 2.
/ - divides the value of the index by 2.

{printing to console}
. - converts the index to a ascii character. if the index is a float. it will convert it too a int before converting it too a ascii character.
.! - prints the index.
.? - goes to the next line in the console.

{get input from console}
, - takes the first character in the input and converts it to a number.

{functions}
() - put the code of the function inside the "()".
: - calls the last defined function.

{while loops}
[] - put the code the while loop should loop.
- the value of the current index is the value it uses to determine how many times it should loop something.
- if the value of the current index is 3. it will loop 3 times.

Example:
>+++ # value of this index is 0. we increment it by 3. it is now 3.
[ # enters while loop.
    <. # goes to the previous index and prints a ascii character.
    >- # goes to the next index and decrements by 1. the index is now 2. these lines of code repeat until this index reaches 0.
] # exits while loop.

[Files.txt Basics]

{sol:}
putting "sol:" instead of "drive:" will get the path to the folder. the interpreter is inside of.

Example:
(Without "sol:"): C:\Desktop\MindFuckInterpreter\Scripts\Scripts.txt
(With "sol:"): sol:Scripts\Script.txt
