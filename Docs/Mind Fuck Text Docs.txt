[MindFuck Info]
all Mind Fuck files need to end in ".mfs".

[Basics]

{changing to a different index}
> - goes to the next index.
< - goes to the previous index.

{changing the value of the index}
+ - increments the value of the index.
- - decrements the value of the index.
* - multiplies the value of the index by 2.
/ - divides the value of the index by 2.

{printing to console}
. - converts the index to a ascii character. if the index is a float. it will convert it too a int before converting it too a ascii character.
.! - prints the index.
.? - goes to the next line in the console.
.& - returns the current index number.

{get input from console}
, - takes the first character in the input and converts it to a number.

{functions}
() - put the code of the function inside the "()".
: - calls the last defined function.

{while loops}
[] - put the code the while loop should loop.
- the value of the current index is the value it uses to determine how many times it should loop something.
- if the value of the current index is 3. it will loop 3 times.

Example:
>+++ # value of this index is 0. we increment it by 3. it is now 3.
[ # enters while loop.
    <. # goes to the previous index and prints a ascii character.
    >- # goes to the next index and decrements by 1. the index is now 2. these lines of code repeat until this index reaches 0.
] # exits while loop.

{if statements}
\ - begining of if statement.
[] - within here you put the index it should compare the index with when you used "\".
operator - after typing "[]" you type the operator you want to use (<, >, <=. >=, ==, !=).
{} - put all code the if statement should execute if it returns True.

Example:
(With Comments):
\[ # gets the first index.
    >
    ] # gets the second index it should compare the first index with.
    > # operator (first index > second index).
    {
    code here.
}

(Without Comments):
\[>]>{
    code here.
}

{#unicode} - default value of "#unicode" is false.
#unicode true - allows you to use all unicode characters up to 1023.
#unicode false - allows you use all ascii characters up to 127.

[Files.txt Basics]

{sol:}
putting "sol:" instead of "drive:" will get the path to the folder. the interpreter is inside of.

Example:
(Without "sol:"): C:\Desktop\MindFuckInterpreter\Scripts\Scripts.mfs
(With "sol:"): sol:Scripts\Script.mfs

[MindFuck Module Functions]

{run() function}
run(file_path) - runs a MindFuck Script.
file_path - the path to the MindFuck Script.
